# Bigrams
Determines the number of bigrams in a text file.

Compile bigrams.c, hashtable.c, and hashtable.h with the makefile included. The .txt files must be in the same folder if you wish to use one of them.
Usage: In bigrams.c on line 29, change book.txt to the desired .txt file when searching for bigrams
Then, in the command line, run: ./bigrams

I have included the following files:
book.txt is Pride and Prejudice
BibleKJV.txt is the King James version of the bible
BoM.txt is the Book of Mormon
DC.txt is The Doctrine and Covenants
NT.txt is The New Testament
OT.txt is The Old Testament
PoGP.txt is The Pearl of Great Price
